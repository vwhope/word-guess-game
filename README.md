# word-guess-game
word-guess (hangman) game

Skills this project demonstrates:
    This word-guess-game is the first homework assignment to include a separate JS file.
    It demonstrates a working knowledge of:
        using JS language
        basic understanding of SCOPE (global vs function level vs nested)
        ability to use an event listener
        ability to get information from the user, evaluate that information, update DOM based on that information
        ability to use a random generator function
    
Goal of game:
    Goal of the game is to guess the hidden word before you run out of guesses.
    You will have 1 more guess than there are letters in the word (ex. if word is 6 characters long, you get 7 guesses)
    The words are randomly selected from an array of words that are related to a Farmer's Market

To run (play) the game:
    open the index.html file in the browser
    press any letter key to guess a letter
    if you guess all the letters in the word before you run out of guesses you win
    if you run out of guesses before you guess the word, you lose
    no matter if you win or lose, a new word will be presented and the game will continue until you stop guessing
